# About The Author

Dan Munro is a software engineer from Seattle, WA. With over a dozen years of professional software development experience, Dan has learned a lot over the course of his career. Sometimes, the knowledge was easy to obtain, however, more often than not, that was not the case. 

While he has never been shy to ask questions, Dan still found he would hear words repeated multiple times before actually starting to understand the meaning behind the words.

Learning has been a lifelong hobby for Dan. Now, teaching is becoming a passion.
