Software engineering has never been an easy profession. 

Knowledge is assumed. Misunderstandings flourish.

An opaque profession does not do itself any favors. This handbook is a modest attempt by the author to lay out an open source glossary of terms, for the benefit of practitioners everywhere.

## Target Audience

It is the author's hope that new software engineers, web developers, programmers, hackers, and any other curious soul finds these documents useful.

Because of this wide target audience, language is kept simple where possible. Complex language creates barriers, and prevents growth. Simplicity promotes understanding.
