Software engineering has never been an easy profession. 

Knowledge is assumed. Misunderstandings flourish.

An opaque profession does not do itself any favors. This handbook is a modest attempt by the author to lay out an open source glossary of terms, for the benefit of practitioners everywhere.

<!--
## Target Audience

Particularly new software engineers, web developers, programmers, hackers, and anyone who has heard a term and wonders what it means, are the target audience for this handbook.
