Software licensing scheme. While each license has its own terms, the primary defining characteristic of open source licensing is that the software is free to use and inspect. Many license types exist. Well known examples include [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License), [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).
