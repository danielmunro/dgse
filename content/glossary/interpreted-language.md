Type of programming language. Contrast to a [compiled language](/glossary/compiled-language).

Interpreted programming languages are programming languages where code is not compiled. Instead, an interpreter runs the code. The interpreter is a layer of software that runs in between the code written by a software developer and the machine running the code.

Because of this additional layer, interpreted languages tend to be slower than compiled ones, in terms of execution time and memory usage. However, the benefits include typically a more flexible [type system](/glossary/type) and syntax.
