Type of programming language. Contrast to a [dynamic language](/glossary/dynamic-language).

Compiled languages are identified by the fact that the target for code is a compiler and not an interpreter. What this means, practically, is that at runtime, the program runs as compiled machine code. There is no interpreter layer.
