A program that specializes in efficient data storage and retrieval. There are a large variety of databases, which serve different purposes. Choosing the right database depends on many factors, such as types and formats of information being stored, whether or not the data is structured, and the overall relatability of data. 

Some of the most popular database types are:

* relational
* document
* graph

A key differentiator from a file system is that a database deals with structured, related, index-able data.

* [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)
* [Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access)

## Document Databases

Examples of document databases include:

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)
* [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)

## Graph Databases

Examples of graph databases include:

* [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
* [Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/)
