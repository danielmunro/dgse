Type of programming language. Contrast to a [compiled language](/glossary/compiled-language).

Dynamic programming languages are programming languages where code is interpreted at runtime. The interpreter is a layer of software that runs in between the code written by a software developer and the machine running the code. 

Because of this additional layer, dynamic languages tend to be slower than compiled ones. However, the benefits include typically a more flexible [type system](/glossary/type) and syntax.
