A smell is a term for an instinct that something is wrong. "Something" in this sense can refer to at least a few possibilities:

* code that is buggy, inconsistent, poorly designed, or error-prone
* a violation of expectations in a live system
* a misunderstanding of the model of code execution

Code smells are typically issues of quality, but this isn't always the case.
