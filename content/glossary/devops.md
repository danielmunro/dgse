Traditionally, "development" and "operations" have had largely separate responsibilities in technology organizations. However, the trend of DevOps is to combine these professions.

One flaw identified by the separation of these responsibilities is that barriers tend to rise, slowing all efforts. The benefit from combining these job responsibilities is that they are essentially two sides to the same issue, and in that sense, the separation was a bad idea in the first place.

As an outcome of this holistic view, DevOps promotes autonomy, ownership, understanding, and automation. [Infrastructure-as-code (IaC)](#infrastructure-as-code-iac) is another big concept related to DevOps.
