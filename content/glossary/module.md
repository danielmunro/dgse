An encapsulation of code, which contains [classes](/glossary/class), [functions](/glossary/function), constants, or other language constructs. Some languages have a concept of a module, but not all do. 

If a programming language does not have modules, typically it will at least support namespaces. Both ideas relate to grouping similar functionality together for organizational or logical purposes.
