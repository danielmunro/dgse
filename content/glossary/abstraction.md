The purpose of a software component, not the component itself. Contrast the two example sentences below:

Example 1:
> This *writer abstraction* is flexible and backend-agnostic.

Example 2:
> This *file system writer implementation* is flexible, but backend-specific.

The first example does not mention _what_ kind of writer the speaker is referencing. The second example, by contrast, references a specific implementation (the filesystem writer).
