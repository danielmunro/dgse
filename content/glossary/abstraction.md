short: The idea behind, or purpose of, a software component.
---

The idea behind, or purpose of, a software component. Contrast the two example sentences below:

Example 1 (abstraction):
> This *writer abstraction* is flexible and backend-agnostic.

Example 2 (implementation):
> This *file system writer implementation* is flexible, but backend-specific.

The first example does not mention _what_ kind of writer the speaker is referencing. The second example, by contrast, references a specific implementation (the filesystem writer).
