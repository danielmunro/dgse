One main goal of ML is to provide computers with the means to solve problems without requiring explicit code to be written to do so.
There are a large variety of ML algorithms, each with different benefits and drawbacks. Some common ways to measure ML algorithms are their: precision, accuracy, recall, and learning rate.</description></item></channel></rss>
