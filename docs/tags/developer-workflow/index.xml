      <description>Acronym. Continuous integration / continuous delivery.
  Concept. Defines a developer workflow whereby code changes go through an automated process after check in.
The first step of the process is integration. Automated tests run, as well as any configured analysis tools.
The second step is delivery. In this case, delivery means automatic deployment of code changes to the next target environment once the integration step completes. Typically, there is more than one target environment, so this process can loop a few times as verification checks happen in each environment.</description>
